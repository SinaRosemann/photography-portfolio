    "detail_first": "I'm not concerned with documenting what a person can see through their eyes, rather, what they could feel if they let their imagination do the seeing. In this regard my work is an abstraction of familiar elements in the world surrounding us, a meditation on the textures that come to life in a certain light, allowing myself and, the viewer a chance to get lost in the most familiar of places.\n I believe the most powerful photographs are ones that can no longer differentiate between the cued memories and the contrived realities. \n Born in Cairo, Egypt \n Lives in ElGouna, Egypt",
