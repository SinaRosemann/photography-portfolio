    "detail_first": "My belief in the immense power of the human mind drives the work in this series. \n Our current state as a species evolved over centuries owing to of our powerful, inspired minds.  Our minds have an innate ability to conjure incredible interpretations of abstract concepts in moments of epiphany, from an understanding of gravity to the conjuring of myths, legends, willpower… faith? Imagination and creativity, two fundamentally different cognitive capabilities, working and building on each other’s visions can achieve anything. \n Our bodies need water to function, yet in the irony of all ironies, our world is covered by water that is unfit to consume, and running out of the precious water that is. Yet its abundance in our oceans is almost absurd. As anyone who has spent time on water will tell you; the sea is immense, and full of possibilities, yet incapable of fulfilling our most basic of needs. A gargantuan body of water, full of possibilities that we cannot consume. Absurd. \n This project explores the most common element on our planet and its magical depth of meaning. A natural mandala, capable of drawing the gaze ever deeper with infinite complexity of form, tonality and meaning.    "
